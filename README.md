# MSSM Orientation Preparation 2022

## Data Structure Assignment

[Description](https://canvas.cmu.edu/courses/29377/assignments/487743) (only accessible for MSSM students and staff)

Here is my solution with sorting. Overall time and space complexity is O(nlogn), where n is the number of lifeguards.

This time I used the programming language I am most familiar with: Go. It provides easy access to sorting and mapping. (I don't think the purpose of this assignment is to make us reinvent the wheels!)

To make it clear, I put all the code in one file (so we can debug it conveniently with `go run`), made sure that the program interacts with standard I/O, and added Big O analysis for core blocks in the function.

Apart from the first dataset, I am not totally sure that my solution is correct. If it's not, then there is something more for me to learn. Isn't that good?
